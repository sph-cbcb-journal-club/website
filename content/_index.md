# UMD Microbiome Journal Club

### Hosted by the Univeristy of Maryland's School of Publish Health and Center for Bioinformatics & Computational Biology

Welcome to the journal club site! This is a joint journal club that alternates its focus on biological and software papers (I think? We'll see!). We meet monthly and alternate locations between the school of public health and the CBCB.

Here we'll post papers we'll be discussing in upcoming meetings and archive papers from previous meetings. We'll also post links to helpful tutorials and software.

All pages not under the root directory of the website are listed below. You can also visit the list page of a single section, e.g., [Meetings](/website/meetings/), or [Resources](/website/resources/). See the [People](/website/people/) page for a list of folks on the mailing list.
